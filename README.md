# Wisdom

## Goal
Wisdom is a platform designed to facilitate knowledge exchange between teachers and students at the Elementary and Middle school levels. Its primary objective is to provide a space where students can post questions related to their schoolwork for teachers to answer. Additionally, students can rate the quality of the teachers' responses. The platform features a main feed showcasing the latest questions from students, which can be filtered by subject, grade, and date. A secondary feed highlights "top" teachers based on their scores, providing visibility to educators. 

## Secondary Goal
In addition to fostering knowledge sharing, Wisdom aims to provide teachers with visibility. Through their engagement on the platform, teachers have increased opportunities to be contacted by students seeking private lessons. This feature not only benefits the teachers but also serves as a marketing tool to attract users to the app.
